# Tic Tac Toe

This tic tac toe web application was developed as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby on Rails Curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com). The purpose was to write JS code where all logic is tucked inside a module or factory.

The game can be played [here](https://naomiflagg.github.io/JS-tic-tac-toe/). Enjoy!
